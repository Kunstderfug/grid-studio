Some brief background information about who you are and what are you looking for would be appreciated.</li>\n<li>I will select two persons who, in my opinion, deserve to be heard and seen. My decision will be final. These names will be listed on my <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SlavaPiano/\" title=\"Facebook studio page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a> studio page with the links to the video or audio we made.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>This option is including 3-hour recording at the studio.</p>\n<p>The limit of the recorded material is about 60 minutes.</p>\n<p>The final result will include audio tracks suitable to print on CD, and one angle video shoot.</p>\n<p>The only thing that you will have to pay for is the piano tuning - about $140.</p>\n<p><strong><em>I will be able to listen to no more than 20 requests per month.</em></strong></p>\n<p>The winners can use this material however they want.</p>\n<p>I will retain the rights to use the excerpts from these recordings as the examples of work for this particular page, for my <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SlavaPiano/\" title=\"Facebook studio page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a> page and on my <a href=\"https://gryaznov-piano-studio.business.site\" title=\"Google Business studio page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Google Business</a> page.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n"}}]}}},"context":{}}
