**Beginning January 2020, I do giveaway recordings once per month.**

I have decided to do this for people who don't have enough money to make a professional recording, but have something to say.

The rules are simple:

<div class="eq">

1. Make a 5-10 minutes long recording of your playing with a phone or whatever device you have, upload it on any cloud, share and send me the link via [email](mailto:gryaznov.studio@gmail.com) with the subject _"giveaway recording request"_. Some brief background information about who you are and what are you looking for would be appreciated.

2. I will select two persons who, in my opinion, deserve to be heard and seen. These names will be listed on my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SlavaPiano/ "Facebook studio page") studio page with the links to the video or audio we made.

</div>

_This option is including 3-hour recording at the studio._

_The limit of the recorded material is about 60 minutes._

_The final result will include audio tracks suitable to print on CD, and one angle video shoot._

<p><em>The only thing that you will have to pay for is the piano tuning - about $140.</em></p>

**I will be able to listen to no more than 20 requests per month.**

The winners can use this material however they want.

I will retain the rights to use the excerpts from these recordings as the examples of work for this particular page, for my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/SlavaPiano/ "Facebook studio page") page and on my [Google Business](https://gryaznov-piano-studio.business.site "Google Business studio page") page.

Good luck!
